1. I have learned a ton of new skills, mostly correct html formatting, i found the project to be very easy after learning on the site, I would never have been able to
   do this project beforehand.

2. Nothing has been easy, i failed and failed until i succeeded but i think my project looks great! :)
3. Nothing has been difficult either, it has only been challenging.
4. I researched around the web to see how i can put the horizontal line above the footer and how to make a superscript number.
